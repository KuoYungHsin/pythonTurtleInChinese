Inspired by the MIT Scratch project, 
a program language capable of supporting programmers' native language ,
will allow more people ( particularly non-English-speaking kids ) able to write the program more fluently.

Starting from Python version 3.0 ,  names of variables, functions, and classes  are encoded in utf-8 ,
that is to say, programmers can write programs in their mother languages. 
I think this will be a key point to make Python overspread even broader and broader.

As long as we can get into many python's modules, provide a set of name aliases for each class, method, and import global variables, then kids or naive people can also write their own programs. Kids include those from K to 12 in non-English-speaking countries, who are not fluent nor possess enough vocabulary in English. 

This program/module implementing the idea is one of the few first tries,
it is an appendix to the Python built-in modules turtle.py, 
which is majorly a bunch of traditional Chinese alias of English name.

This file is named as turtle_tc.py, to emphasize it is majorly in traditional Chinese.

Similar modification can be made to make it suitable in any non-English language. 

This file can be run by itself, 
it can also be put in the path of Python library, 
and be imported by the other application of turtle programs

To use Chinese names could not only make the program more readable for local Chinese speaking programmers, 
it could also make the program more compact, dense and beautiful.
